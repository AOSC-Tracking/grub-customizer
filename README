Make sure your grub2 contains the grub-mkconfig script (included since version 1.97).

# step one: Install these packages:

 * cmake
 * g++ OR gcc-c++
 * libgtkmm-2.4-dev OR gtkmm24-devel (>= 2.18)
 * gettext
 * libssl-dev OR openssl-devel

(The package names may be different, depending on the distribution they are using on)

# step two: download the sources:

download the tar.gz-package here: https://launchpad.net/grub-customizer/+download
â€¦and extract its contents.

# step three: compile the sources:

Go into the source directory extracted from the tar.gz file, then run

$ cmake . && make

If you get a cmake version error, try to set the "cmake_minimum_required" value to your
installed version - I only written down the lowest tested version, so older versions may be compatible too.

# step four: install some (optional) runtime dependencies:

 * hwinfo

# step five: install Grub Customizer

$ sudo make install

Then you can start Grub Customizer using the menu or by running `gksu grub-customizer` / `sudo grub-customizer`

On some distributions, this may fail ("bootloader not found"), because some of the commands / directories doesn't
exist on the expected names. Please make sure, these commands are accessible:

grub-mkconfig
grub-install

and these pathes/files:

/etc/grub.d
/boot/grub
/boot/grub/grub.cfg
/etc/default/grub

If not, there may be alternative commands/pathes, if Grub2 is installed. Please try to find them out and create
a config file at /etc/grub-customizer/grub.cfg containing this content (the values of this example are valid on
fedora 16 - change them, if they are different):

MKCONFIG_CMD=grub2-mkconfig
INSTALL_CMD=grub2-install
MKFONT_CMD=grub2-mkfont
CFG_DIR=/etc/grub.d
OUTPUT_DIR=/boot/grub2
OUTPUT_FILE=/boot/grub2/grub.cfg
SETTINGS_FILE=/etc/default/grub
DEVICEMAP_FILE="/boot/grub2/device.map"
MKDEVICEMAP_CMD="grub2-mkdevicemap --device-map=/dev/stdout"
