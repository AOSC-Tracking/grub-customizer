grub-customizer (1.6-0ubuntu1~ppa1m) maverick; urgency=medium

   * bug #661304 fixed (multiple scripts using the same basename will not be overwritten anymore)
   * (new entries) will be displayed on uncustomized scripts too (the old behaviour was to fuzzy)
   * the test, if a script requires a proxy, is now solved dynamically (the previous behaviour was: when it's modified, set proxy_required)
   * the live cd setup assistant is now (renamed to partition chooser) accessible after loading (by menubutton click) or if no bootloader found too
   * the toolbar button for saving the configuration is now marked as is_important (will be displayed larger in most cases)
